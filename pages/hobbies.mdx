## Sports
Since I was born, basketball and football had become a part of my life. I played in local tourneys and leagues when I was 
10 years old as I sought my way to improve and lead my teams to winning seasons and championships. Now, I play casually
with my friends at the park and gym.


## Gaming
As an avid gamer, I love to spend time with my friends and family by playing video games. We spend lots of time not only
playing games, but talking and creating memories that last for life. Some genres I play include FPS, MOBA, and Role-Playing.
Although I mainly play casually, I tend to have a competitive edge and play in local tournaments to showcase my skills. 
I also love to record and stream my gameplay for everyone to watch!


## Food
Food is my safe haven. My love for food comes with learning how to cook and explore foods from different
cultures. Throughout Los Angeles and Orange County, I've had my fair share of wonderful cuisines from all parts of
Eastern Asia all the way to various parts of Europe.
