As a developer, there is not a day where I would not be programming.
My brain always has ideas, from small to large, and I tend to have a drive to transform these ideas to the real world.
I have listed a couple of notable projects in this portfolio. To view more open-source projects, please visit my [Github](https://github.com/jdinh-782).
