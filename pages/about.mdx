I created this website portfolio to showcase my work and glimpses of my life as I further my learning and career as a
Machine Learning Analyst. I also have experience with the duties and  responsibilities of a Software Engineer, Game Developer, and a UX/UI Designer. 
I hope you are able to follow alongside with me as I continue to advance forward in my journey!
