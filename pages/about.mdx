I created this website portfolio to showcase my work and glimpses of my life as I further my learning and career as a
Machine Learning Analyst. Although that is my primary focus, I am more than comfortable following the role and 
responsibilities of a Software Engineer, Game Developer, and a UX/UI Designer. I hope you are able to follow alongside
with me as I continue to advance forward in my journey!
