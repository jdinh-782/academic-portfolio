## JPMorgan Chase & Co.
 
My first internship and the first of many work experiences to come. I had the tremendous opportunity to learn from the 
best teams about the software development process, web development frameworks, and peer networking. With my profound 
knowledge, I helped construct a web application showcasing visualizations and analytics for business applications and 
client data.

Invited by JPMorgan Chase & Co., I cooperated with teams of aspiring software engineers to design web and mobile 
applications for sponsored non-profit organizations. With 200+ people present, we all learned about the power of 
programming on activism. We focused on bringing the organizations' message to life through design and user experience.


## University of California, Irvine
During my time at UC Irvine, I've had the chance to tutor and provide notes for all students. As a note taker under the
Disability Services Center, I helped organize and prepare hand-written notes for courses with topics ranging from 
Discrete Mathematics, Machine Learning, and Data Management.


## SciOlympiad

From tutoring and mentoring math and computer science topics to adminstering STEM events, I had the opportunity to 
supervise and be a judge for Science Olympiad. During this time, I was able to learn more about the recruiting and 
scoring process for teams competing to have the best project in various fields of science and technology.
