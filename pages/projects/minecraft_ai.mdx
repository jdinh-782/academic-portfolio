# Minecraft Ai


## Description
In this project, a reinforcement learning (RL) agent is developed to navigate a challenging race track within a Minecraft world. The environment is created using the Malmo Framework, a powerful tool that enables AI experimentation within the Minecraft universe.

The core objective is to train the agent to complete the race track within a specified timeframe. The track is deliberately designed with obstacles and boundaries to increase the complexity of the task, requiring the agent to consistently learn and refine its pathing strategies.

The agent is trained using the Epsilon-Greedy Q-learning algorithm, a popular RL technique that balances exploration of new paths with the exploitation of known successful strategies. Epsilon-Greedy allows the agent to initially explore the environment extensively, experimenting with different actions to discover the most efficient routes. As the training progresses, the agent increasingly exploits the best-known paths, fine-tuning its behavior to minimize the time taken to complete the track.

The obstacles and boundaries in the race track serve as crucial learning points for the agent, forcing it to adapt and overcome challenges that mimic real-world decision-making scenarios. These features ensure that the agent's learning process is robust, allowing it to handle a variety of situations and refine its strategy with each run.

Over time, the agent learns the optimal path to navigate the track, efficiently avoiding obstacles and adhering to the boundaries. The goal is to reach a level of performance where the agent can consistently complete the race within the desired timeframe, demonstrating a deep understanding of the environment and the ability to apply learned strategies effectively.
