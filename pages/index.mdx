# Introduction
 
Hello! My name is Johnson, and this is my academic portfolio. Prior to becoming a full-time software engineer, I obtained
my **Associate of Arts in Engineering and Technology** at [Pasadena City College](https://pasadena.edu/) and my 
**Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science** at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/).
During my time then, I specialized in fundamental and advanced courses in computer science, mathematics, and statistics.

I am currently pursuing my **Master's of Science in Computer Science** at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). 
My current studies revolve around topics related to data analytics, machine learning, and robotics. This portfolio acts as a way
for users to view my academic history and experiences from inside the classroom. 
My projects are an extensive reflection of the knowledge I applied from my learning of the materials.
