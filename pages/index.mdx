# Introduction
 
Welcome to my website portfolio! My name is Johnson, and I am a Software Applications Developer for Parcel Pro
at UPS Capital. I am a recent graduate from the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/), where I
received my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree. My primary areas of focus other than software engineering
include machine learning and game development. With machine learning, I specialize in computer vision and intelligence.
In the realm of game development, I tend to use low-level tools to create 2D/3D applications.


## Experience
I have previously interned and accomplished hands-on experience at companies such as 
[JPMorgan Chase & Co.](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/), [Science Olympiad](https://www.soinc.org/), 
and at the University of California, Irvine. Topics vary from software engineering to hands-on
instruction experience. <br/>

## Academia

In the midst of learning, my coureswork and learning revolves around Computer Science, Statistics, and Mathematics.
With a heavy interest in artificial intelligence, I spent a lot of time studying machine learning, probability,
and linear algebra. Other courses I have taken include software engineer, human computer interaction, and database
management. <br/>

## Hobbies
Outside of academia, I love to play and watch sports such as basketball and football. I also enjoy going for walks
at the beach or at various sceneries. If nature calls, I might go hiking in the mountains or hills. As a natural gamer,
I like to play various genres, however, I mainly play [League of Legends](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/) 
and [Valorant](https://playvalorant.com/) -- Riot Games enthusiast :) <br/>
